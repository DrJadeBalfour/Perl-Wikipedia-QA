# Perl-Wikipedia-QA
This was created for my Natural Language Processing class.  It uses the CPAN module WWW::Wikipedia to answer a simple Who/What/When/Where question.  The answer returned must be processed before it is given.  Included in this repository is the QA system itself, a sample output file, and a simple batch file to run the program.  The output includes about 20 questions I used for the assignment.  It begins with the question, then what was searched in Wikipedia, what was returned from Wikipedia, and lastly the answer given.  Not all of the answers are accurate and some of the questions receive a message asking for clarification or that nothing was found.
