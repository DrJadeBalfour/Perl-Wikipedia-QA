}} }} 'Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill' (30&nbsp;November&nbsp;187424 January 1965) was a British statesman who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955.
Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a non-academic historian, and a writer (as Winston S. Churchill).
He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for his overall, lifetime body of work.
In 1963, he was the first of only eight people to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.
Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family.
His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite.
As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, the AngloSudan War, and the Second Boer War.
He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns.
At the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions.
Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of Asquith's Liberal government.
During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government.
He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers.
He returned to government under Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, then Secretary of State for the Colonies.
After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Baldwin's Conservative government of 19241929, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy.
Out of office and politically "in the wilderness" during the 1930s because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII, Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament.
At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty.
Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister.
His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 194041 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler.
He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.
After the Conservative Party suffered an unexpected defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government.
He publicly warned of an "Iron Curtain" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity.
After winning the 1951 election, Churchill again became Prime Minister.
His second term was preoccupied by foreign affairs, including the Malayan Emergency, Mau Mau Uprising, Korean War, and a UK-backed coup d'tat in Iran.
Domestically his government laid great emphasis on house-building.
Churchill suffered a serious stroke in 1953 and retired as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1964.
Upon his death aged ninety in 1965, Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral, which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history.
Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history, consistently ranking well in opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom.
His highly complex legacy continues to stimulate intense debate amongst writers and historians.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]] (May 1962).
In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as personalities independent and resenting of the other.
Following his accidental exposure to gamma radiation during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life.
The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger.
Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right.
Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast, including Banner's lover Betty Ross, his friend Rick Jones, his cousin She- Hulk, sons Hiro-Kala and Skaar, and his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers.
However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others.
Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] and [[Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].
Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green.
He has two main catchphrases: "Hulk is strongest one there is!" and the better- known "HULK SMASH!", which has founded the basis for numerous pop culture memes.
One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media.
Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations, including the 1970s [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]] television series (played by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno respectively) and in film by Eric Bana, Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo.

Who is Katy Perry?
Perry
'Perry' is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears, similar to the way cider is made from apples.
It has been common for centuries in England, particularly in the Three Counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire); it is also made in parts of South Wales and France, especially Normandy and Anjou.
In more recent years, commercial perry has also been referred to as "pear cider", but some organisations (such as CAMRA) do not accept this as a name for the traditional drink.
The National Association of Cider Makers, on the other hand, disagrees, insisting that the terms perry and pear cider are interchangeable.Pear cider ruling gives perry a timely boost, [[The Grocer]], 19-05-2007 An over twenty-fold increase of sales of industrially manufactured "pear cider" produced from often imported concentrate makes the matter especially contentious.

What is a Car?
Car
car' is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry.
Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car.
In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century.
One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.
Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights.
Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.
Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment.
Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by deflagration of gasoline (also known as petrol) or diesel.
Both fuels cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming.
Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries.
Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008.
There are costs and benefits to car use.
The costs of car usage include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.
The costs to society of car use include: maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.

When was Jesus born?
Jesus
Prophet of the New Millennium.']
Course handbook, p. 10 (Lecture Three.
V. B.) The Teaching Company, 2000, Lecture 24.
"The notion that the Gospel accounts are not completely accurate but still important for the religious truths they try to convey is widely shared in the scholarly world, even though it's not so widely known or believed outside of it."
Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as "rabbi".
He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.
Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers.
After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.
His birth is celebrated annually on December 25 (or various dates in January for some eastern churches) as a holiday known as Christmas, his crucifixion is honored on Good Friday, and his resurrection is celebrated on Easter.
The widely used calendar era "AD", from the Latin anno Domini ("in the year of the Lord"), and the alternative "CE", are based on the approximate birth date of Jesus.
Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, whence he will return.
Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God.
The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology.
The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity.
A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.
In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ) is considered one of God's important prophets and the Messiah.
Muslims believe Jesus was a bringer of scripture and was born of a virgin but was not the Son of God.
The Quran states that Jesus himself never claimed divinity.
To most Muslims, Jesus was not crucified but was physically raised into Heaven by God.
Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill Messianic prophecies and asserting that his resurrection is a Christian legend.

When is Martin Luther King Day?
 Martin Luther King Day 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day' (officially 'Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.') is an American federal holiday marking the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.
It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around King's birthday, January 15.
The holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act.
King was the chief spokesman for nonviolent activism in the Civil Rights Movement, which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law.
The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968.
President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later.
At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays.
It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.

Where is Hungary?
Hungary
Hungary' (; ) is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe.
It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin, and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast.
With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union.
The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language in Europe.
Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as a global city.
Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pcs and Gyr.
Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts, Romans, Slavs, Gepids and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince rpd in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin.
His great- grandson Stephen I ascended to the throne in 1000, converting the country to a Christian kingdom.
By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the Western world, reaching a golden age by the 15th century.Krist Gyula Barta Jnos Gergely Jen: Magyarorszg trtnete elidktl 2000-ig (History of Hungary from the prehistory to 2000), Pannonica Kiad, Budapest, 2002, ISBN 963-9252-56- 5, p. 687, pp.

616644 Following the Battle of Mohcs in 1526 and about 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation (15411699), Hungary came under Habsburg rule, and later formed the great power AustroHungarian Empire together with Austria.
Hungary's current borders were established in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon after World War I, when the country lost 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians.
Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties.
Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship (19471989).
The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc.
On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic.
In the 21st century, Hungary is a middle power and has the world's 57th largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the 58th largest by PPP, out of 188 countries measured by the IMF.
As a substantial actor in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's 36th largest exporter and importer of goods.

Where is Rome?
Rome
Rome' ( ; , ) is a special comune (named Comune di Roma Capitale) and the capital of Italy.
Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region.
With 2,873,598 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated comune and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits.
It is the center of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4.3 million residents.
The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber.
The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.
Rome's history spans more than 2,500 years.
While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at only around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.Heiken, G., Funiciello, R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City.
Princeton University Press.
The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines.
Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilisation and by some as the first ever metropolis.
It was first called The Eternal City (; ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.Stephanie Malia Hom, "Consuming the View: Tourism, Rome, and the Topos of the Eternal City", Annali d'Igtalianistica '28':91116 Rome is also called the "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World).
After the fall of the Western Empire, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, which had settled in the city since the 1st century AD, until in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870.
Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all the popes since Nicholas V (144755) pursued coherently along four hundred years an architectonic and urbanistic programme aimed to make of the city the world's artistic and cultural centre.
Due to that, Rome became first one of the major centres of the Italian Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism.
Famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city.
In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.
Rome has the status of a global city.
Rome ranked in 2014 as the 14th-most- visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist attraction in Italy.
Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
Monuments and museums such as the Vatican Museums and the Colosseum are among the world's most visited tourist destinations with both locations receiving millions of tourists a year.
Rome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics and is the seat of United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 438, the largest margin of victory for an underdog and tied for the third largest point differential overall (35) in Super Bowl history with Super Bowl XXVII (1993).
It was the first time the winning team scored over 40 points, while holding their opponent to under 10.
This became the first Super Bowl victory for the Seahawks and the fifth Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, the most of any team.
The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold- weather city and the first Super Bowl to be played on a February 2.

Seattle built a 220 halftime lead, and then a 360 advantage before allowing Denver's first and only score on the final play of the third quarter.
The Seahawks defense scored a safety on the first play from scrimmage, the quickest score in Super Bowl history.
They also became the first team in a Super Bowl to score on a safety, a kickoff return for a touchdown, and an interception return for a touchdown.
The Broncos were held to almost 30 points below their scoring average.
Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, a five-time NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, threw two interceptions in the first half.
Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith, who returned one of those interceptions 69-yards for a touchdown, recovered a fumble and made nine tackles, was named Super Bowl MVP.
In the United States, the game was televised by Fox; with an average audience of 111.5&nbsp;million viewers, and peaking at 115.3&nbsp;million during the halftime show featuring Bruno Mars, the game was briefly the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of all time, until it was surpassed the following year.
